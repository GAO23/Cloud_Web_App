# Intro
My very own cloud drive. I am sick of paying for cloud drive storage. I try running my own cloud storage services with open source softwares like next cloud but became utterly frustarted with how complicated it is to set them up, not to mention its desktop and web client are terrible and the web pages are slow. After some time of frustatrted user expereiences, I came to the realization, if I want my very own cloud storage running on my very own machines, I might as well as do everything from scratch, including coding the entire software from the ground up. At least then I can create an application that have only the essential features I need minus all the bloats. So far, it already is running much faster than running those open source solutions. 

# Project plans

1) Creating the backend server which will store all the uploaded contents which is mostly done. Now constanly doing bug fixes and adding more features as the front end progresses. Uses node.js and mongodb database.

2) Creating the front end web application in react which will provide the browser means for user to access their cloud drive. 

3) Creating desktop client using JavaFX as soon as the front end web application is finished. I much perfer an actual desktop application over a browser for mass file uploads, downloads, and syncs. 

4) Creating an android app for it to provide the means for moobile app users to access the cloud storage without a browser. Lets face it, cloud drive on mobile browser is hardly useable. An app is needed. I will start on this as soob as the desktop client finishes.
